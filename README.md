# Festo Coding Challenge 2022

A project of the solutions for the [Festo Coding Challenge 2022](https://2022.coding-challenge.festo.com).

This code is not optimized or well thought out, it is here to get the job done. ðŸ˜„

This coding challenge is really fun, yet challenging enough to be engaging and interesting. ðŸ”¥

## Contents

- Each folder is named after the sub-challenge it solves.
- The `py_exec_boiler.sh` is an executable shell script I made to create boiler plate code for me. It gets 1-2 arguments, the first being the file name and the second (optional) being the number of sub-puzzles. If the second argument is not defined, it just creates a main function.
- Since I do not have the rights to any of the puzzle data provided, they are not included in the repo. This repo only contains the code I wrote to solve the puzzles.
- I forgot to include the .vscode directory in the gitignore file, so you will have to live with that. ðŸ¤™
